--------------------------------------------------

Releases are named like *astrometry.net-0.42.tar.gz*

Snapshots are named like *astrometry.net-21979.tar.gz*.  The number
is the "subversion" version-control number.

For both releases and snapshots, we always recommend the most recent,
since of course we don't believe we ever make the code *worse* by
working on it!

There is not a huge difference in quality between snapshots and
releases.  In general, we make a release when some important bugfix
has gone in, or if a number of smaller features or bugfixes have
accumulated.  We usually make a snapshot when we want someone to test
something for us.
