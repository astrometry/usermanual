Astrometry.net user manual
==========================

Issue tracking for Astrometry.net projects, and a place to work on The
Long-Missing Manual.

[Read it on the web](http://astrometry.net/doc2) -- updated from the
git repo every 5 minutes.

If you have a question about how to use the Astrometry.net code
(*solve-field*, etc), or the http://nova.astrometry.net web service,
please search the manual, or the existing issues.  If you don't find
an answer, please post a new issue.  We will try to answer it and pull
the answer into the manual.  It's fine to just ask a question in an
issue --- the "issue" is that the answer to your question wasn't clear
from the documentation!
